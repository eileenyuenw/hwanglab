            The intersection of <span>metabolism</span> and <span>neuroscience:</span><br>
Discovering the effects of diabetes and obesity on the brain

                The brain utilizes glucose as its primary energy source and consumes more glucose than any other organ in the body. Consequently, changes in glucose metabolism and homeostasis critically impact brain glucose levels, which in turn can indicate broader imbalances in a person’s metabolic state. Lower brain glucose uptake across the blood-brain barrier is associated with obesity and diabetes as well as neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. 
    
    <br> <br>The interconnected nature of these metabolic diseases as well as their pervasive impact on lives across the globe highlight the need for continuing research on the mechanisms behind these changes in metabolism as well as potential biomarkers to look for to enhance prevention and treatment. The Hwang Lab, working together with many other scientists, is at the forefront of research examining the brain as a central energy sensor that directs and responds to the glucose regulation of the body. 
    <br> <br> Through techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fMRI, PET imaging, and hyperglycemic clamp, the Hwang Lab examines a range of complex metabolic processes including brain glucose kinetics, sympathetic nervous system activity, hormone signaling in the context of glucose regulation, and the neurocognitive effects of diabetes and obesity. Ultimately, this research goes into advancing patient care in the field of endocrinology as well as the myriad of other body systems affected by energy utilization and hormone signaling.

                The Hwang Lab utilizes a combination of advanced brain imaging modalities and classic investigative techniques in metabolism to understand how diabetes and obesity induce changes in the brain and the rest of the body.
