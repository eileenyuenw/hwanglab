                <span>Janice Jin Hwang, MD, MHS,</span> is the Chief of the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Hwang is a leading expert in metabolic neuroscience, with research focused on how obesity and diabetes affect brain glucose metabolism and function.

<br><br>Her NIH-funded work employs advanced neuroimaging to explore the links between metabolic disorders and cognitive health, particularly in pediatric and aging populations. 

At UNC, she is deeply committed to training the next generation of endocrinologists and clinician-scientists, mentoring students, residents, and fellows. Nationally, she contributes to the American Diabetes Association and NIH through scientific review and planning committees. 
<br><br>Dr. Hwang’s multidisciplinary approach bridges endocrinology, neuroscience, and public health, advancing understanding of the brain-metabolism connection and improving outcomes for patients living with diabetes and obesity.
